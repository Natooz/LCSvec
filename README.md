# LCSTorch

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) extension for PyTorch tensors

## TODOs

* batch methods, i.e. supporting 2D arrays;
* batch methods with any number of dimensions (nD array) and add a `dim` argument;
* make it work with an unlimited number of sequences, and set `dim` and `pad_token` as kwargs only;
